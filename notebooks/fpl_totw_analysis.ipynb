    "One of the main objectives participants of fantasy sports competitions try to achieve is assembling the best-performing team over the course of an entire season. Typically, performance is based on points accrued by each participant's team chosen during a each period of the competition, which can last days, weeks, or months. Most major sports leagues have branded fantasy leagues for theire respective competitions. In this study, data collected from the English Premier League's Fantasy Premier League over the past five years will be disseminated to understand the challenge of choosing a team of 11 starters and four substitues can be, such that the points accrued by the team over each competition period is maximized.\n",
